# Static-only, no backend

This project must stay a **static, client-only** app. Every change must preserve that.

## Hard constraints

- **No backend** – No server-side code, APIs, or server you depend on.
- **No database** – No DB, no server-side storage. Use only URL hash, localStorage, or other browser APIs.
- **No build required** – No mandatory compile step; optional tooling is fine only if the repo still works as plain HTML/CSS/JS.
- **Host anywhere** – Deploy as static files only (e.g. GitHub Pages, Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, or any file server). No special runtime.

## In practice

- New features: implement in the browser (HTML/CSS/JS in this repo).
- Data: URL hash, localStorage, sessionStorage, IndexedDB, or in-page state only.
- Links and “pages”: encoded in URLs/hash or in document text, not in a server or DB.

Reject or redesign any addition that would require a backend, database, or non-static hosting.
